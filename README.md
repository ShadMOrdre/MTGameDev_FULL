# MTGameDev_FULL

Please be aware this download is around 400MB or larger.  Alternative instructions included for lighter downloads.

INSTRUCTIONS:

Extract the downloaded zip file into a *new* world folder of your choice.  Please do not use this on existing worlds, or, back that world up and use this only on a copy.

You can alternately download parts of this seperately, for a lighter experience.  To do so, download map_meta.txt and world.mt into a new world folder, create a game/mods folder, and extract only the downloaded tarballs that you prefer into the game/mods folder.

The included tarballs, fully extracted into the game/mods folder, will include the following modpacks.

lib_additions
lib_default_mtg
lib_develop
lib_extras
lib_game
lib_geology
lib_items
lib_legacy
lib_life
lib_player
lib_sounds
lib_system
lib_technology

Other mods considered, but too large to fit here, are:
gramaphone, nssm, nsspf, and pedology.

Larger goals are integration.  Many of these mods could be combined for simplicity, reduction of code, refactored for efficiency, and updated to use new features.

I like immersion.  I want to do away with the formspec based craft grid, and use alternative methods for acquiring goods.  The rainbarrel mod as well as others, and my own lib_tools:drafting_table node work in this direction.  The craft table does, atm, require one to position it while looking north.  The crafts only work when laid out in that direction.  This is on my agenda to get working correctly, but I like the effect, and it should craft all registered crafts.

Other mods, like advtrains, mesecons, pipeworks, are untouched by me.  The included copies of those mods may not be the newest versions of those mods.  Where necessary, and undocumented by me, mods are updated to work with MTv5.0.  3darmor, player_anim, and skins_db should all work.  If there is an issue, remove the clothing mod from lib_extras.

My dev machine is an Intel Pentium, 2.4GHz, 8GB ram with built in graphics, running Lubuntu17.10.   Not as lowend as my laptops, but enough to run a headless server console instance, and a client running on the same computer.  The laptops play ok, with low distance viewing ranges.

For some, this is a very heavy mod load.  You can safely use only the lib_geology, lib_default_mtg, lib_player and lib_system modpacks for the "lightest" experience
